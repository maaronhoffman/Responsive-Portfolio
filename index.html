It is difficult to get this kind of work done at an affordable rate, but I offer just that. I have several years of experience in design and production, in a variety of industries, including TV and Music. I have the trust of one of the most talented producers in LA, DJ Quik, who respects my technical abilities and appreciates my work.</p>
